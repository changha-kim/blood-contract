## Goal
Spike wall + knockback allows skillful punish but prevents **infinite pin/loop**.

## Steps
1) Lure enemy into spike wall.
2) Attempt repeated knockback pin.
3) Try to reproduce infinite loop (2–3 times).

## What to record
- Can you pin infinitely? Y/N
- If yes: exact repro steps (critical):
- If no: what breaks the loop (cooldown, i-frames, resistance, AI escape):
- Any edge cases (corner jitter, collision bugs):

## Verdict
PASS / MIXED / FAIL

## Notes / actions
- Tunables to adjust:
