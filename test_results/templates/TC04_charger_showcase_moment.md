## Meta

- Build id / commit:
- Platform:
- Scene/Layout:
- Recording: `artifacts/TC04_...`

## Goal
Within 5 attempts, create the moment: **bait committed charge into spike wall**.

## Steps
Attempt up to 5 times:
1) Trigger charge.
2) Wait for commit lock.
3) Sidestep/dash; let execution path hit spike wall.

## What to record
- Success achieved? Y/N
- Attempts to first success: 1/2/3/4/5/none
- Failure reasons (pick):
  - commit window unclear
  - dash timing unreliable
  - hitboxes/collision inconsistent
  - spike wall rules unclear
  - camera/visibility
- Best clip timestamp:

## Verdict
PASS / MIXED / FAIL

## Notes / actions
