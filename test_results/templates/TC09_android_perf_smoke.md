## Goal
Performance/input on Android does not break **commit-read + dash** gameplay.

2) Do 10 commit-dodge attempts; count successes.
3) Optional: 3 spike-wall showcase attempts.

## What to record
- FPS: min ____ / avg ____ (or qualitative)
- Stutters/jank frequency:
- Touch issues (missed taps, latency):
- Commit-dodge success rate: ____ / 10
- Thermal/throttling after 5–10 min:

## Verdict
PASS / MIXED / FAIL
