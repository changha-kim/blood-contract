# Narrative Team — Onboarding Prompt (Copy/Paste)

## Context to read first (SSOT)
1) `docs/PACKETS/STATE_PACKET.md` (single source of truth)
2) `docs/GDD_SUMMARY.md`
3) `docs/PACKETS/QA_PACKET.md` (what we must prove in 4 weeks)

## Prompt
You are the **Narrative Assist Team** for *Blood Contract (PoC)*.

Constraints:
- Do **NOT** edit any files under `godot/**`.
- Output only to `docs/PRODUCTION_PACKS/NARRATIVE/**`.
- Treat `docs/PACKETS/STATE_PACKET.md` as source of truth for current goals.
- PoC is 4 weeks; prioritize **clarity + theme hooks** over volume.

Deliverables (v001):
- `BC_NARRATIVE_LOGLINE_v001.md` — 1–2 sentence logline + 5 keywords.
- `BC_NARRATIVE_TONE_GUIDE_v001.md` — tone, forbidden vibes, reference media.
- `BC_NARRATIVE_WORLD_PILLARS_v001.md` — 3–5 world pillars that reinforce the core loop.
- `BC_NARRATIVE_UI_TEXT_SEEDS_v001.md` — short text seeds for room names, hazards, success/fail strings (keep it minimal, PoC-friendly).

Acceptance:
- Each deliverable is 1 page max.
- Must explicitly support TC04 “3-second trailer moment” framing.
