# TASK_PACKET — Audio P0: wall_hit_impact + lock_primary (TC04 + TC01)

- Generated by: DEV_DISPATCHER (auto)
- Branch: `auto/task_packet_auto_20260219_174321_audio-p0-add-wall_hit_impact-lock_primary-`
- Priority: P0

## Goal
Unblock PoC readability by ensuring we have **audible cues** for:
- **TC01** Commit/LOCK moment (telegraph → commit distinction)
- **TC04** SpikeWall enemy impact (clear hit confirmation)

## Scope
- Add minimal SFX assets to the repo (placeholder-quality acceptable for PoC).
- Wire SFX playback:
  - LOCK moment → `lock_primary`
  - SpikeWall enemy hit → `wall_hit_impact`

## Acceptance Criteria
- TC01: When commit becomes locked (LOCK), an audible cue plays once per lock entry.
- TC04: When an enemy takes damage from SpikeWall, a clear impact SFX plays near the impact point.
- No new dependencies (ffmpeg etc). Must work on a clean checkout.

## Implementation Notes
- Assets live under: `godot/assets/audio/sfx/`
  - `sfx_lock_primary.wav`
  - `sfx_wall_hit_impact.wav`
- Wiring points:
  - `scripts/fx/telegraph_indicator.gd` → lock SFX on commit
  - `scripts/hazards/spike_wall.gd` → wall-hit impact SFX on enemy hit

## QA
- Quick manual: run TC01/TC04 in-editor and confirm both SFX are audible.
- If Godot import hiccups on first load, re-open project once and retry.
