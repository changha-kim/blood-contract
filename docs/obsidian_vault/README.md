# Obsidian Vault (Blood Contract)

This folder is an **Obsidian vault**: a plain folder of Markdown files that Obsidian reads as a linked knowledge base.

## How to open
1) Install Obsidian: https://obsidian.md
2) Obsidian → **Open folder as vault**
3) Select this folder: `blood_contract/docs/obsidian_vault/`

## How we use it (PoC)
- Keep project navigation + links here.
- Source-of-truth spec files remain in repo under `docs/PACKETS/`.
- We **link to** those PACKETS from this vault.

## Start here
- Open `00_DASHBOARD.md`
- For a full flow view: `02_PROJECT_FLOW_DASHBOARD.md`
- For rules: `01_OPERATING_RULES.md`
