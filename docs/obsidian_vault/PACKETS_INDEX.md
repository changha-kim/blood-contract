# PACKETS — Index

These are the repo SSOT files (we keep them in `docs/PACKETS/`).

## Primary packets
- [STATE_PACKET (SSOT)](../PACKETS/STATE_PACKET.md)
- [PLAN_PACKET](../PACKETS/PLAN_PACKET.md)
- [QA_PACKET](../PACKETS/QA_PACKET.md)
- [TASK_PACKET](../PACKETS/TASK_PACKET.md)

## How to use in practice
- Start every day from **STATE_PACKET**.
- For "what to do next" → PLAN_PACKET.
- For "how to measure" → QA_PACKET.
- For "what to implement now" → TASK_PACKET.

## Local navigation pages
